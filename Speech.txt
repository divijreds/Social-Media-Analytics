In the industrial revolution 4.0 which is the information and digit revolution, there is a lot of data available to us at our disposal. So it is now time to use this data to our advantage. There is a lot of technological advancements which are happening currently and data-driven apps are being developed. Our application is one such small part of this revolution.

Our aim was to develop an analytical solution for a brand or a company to analyze their customer feedbacks and thus improve the customer satisfaction in process.

One of our purpose of developing this project was also to learn and work upon the graph database named neo4j.
